# Low-Latency Trading System, what it does:

I deployed a high-performance VM as close as I can to the NYSE.

The physical proximity is what makes my ping faster than yours if you are not in US east.

I have high computing power in my VM that is useful for intensive backtesting (tbd)

## Latency Results (pings)
- **Dublin → S&P data**: 81ms average
- **East US VM → S&P data**: 6ms average (92% latency reduction from my laptop)
- **Citadel → S&P data**: >1ms according to Claude

## Infrastructure 
![Built in Azure](./assets/infra.png)

Can you be faster than me? :) --> if you want to try:

# Setup

1. go to Alpaca, create account, get API keys for paper trading from your dashboard
2. clone repo in VS code
3. in VS terminal bash: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. in VS terminal bash:
   $env:ALPACA_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   $env:ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-here"
5. go
   
##Prerequisits:
- Python 3.12+
- Azure account (for VM deployment)
